**H**\ ofstadter\ **T**\ ools (\ **HT**) is a set of Python programs and classes for analyzing the Hofstadter model, which describes the behavior of non-interacting quantum particles hopping on a lattice coupled to a gauge field. This package can be used to compute the band structure of a *generalized* Hofstadter model on *any* regular Euclidean lattice, as well as its key properties, such as quantum geometry and topology.

.. admonition:: About the name

    Philip Harper first derived the difference equation for the model [`Harper55 <https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0370-1298/68/10/304>`__], which was later analyzed in detail by Mark Azbel [`Azbel64 <http://jetp.ras.ru/cgi-bin/e/index/e/19/3/p634?a=list>`__], and finally plotted by Douglas Hofstadter [`Hofstadter76 <https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.14.2239>`__]. Consequently, the formal name for the model is the *Harper-Azbel-Hofstadter model* to credit its three main contributors.

Quick Start
-----------

Installing HofstadterTools is quick and easy!

Using pip:

.. code:: console

    pip install HofstadterTools

Using conda:

.. code:: console

    conda install conda-forge::HofstadterTools

You can now access the ``band_structure`` and ``butterfly`` programs from any location. The ``band_structure`` program evaluates the Hofstadter band structure at fixed flux density :math:`n_\phi=p/q` for a range of momenta :math:`\mathbf{k}=(k_x,k_y)`, whereas the ``butterfly`` program evaluates the energy spectrum at fixed momentum :math:`\mathbf{k}=\mathbf{0}` for a range of :math:`n_\phi=p/q`, where :math:`p` and :math:`q` are coprime integers.

.. code:: console

    band_structure -lat square -nphi 1 4 --display both --wilson

Voil√†! You have just plotted the Hofstadter band structure for nearest-neighbor hopping on the square lattice at flux density :math:`n_\phi=1/4`, together with the corresponding butterfly spectrum at :math:`q=97`. You can append ``--help`` to either of these programs to view the list of options. Alternatively, you can explore the `gallery <https://hofstadter.tools/gallery.html>`__ and `code reference <https://hofstadter.tools/_autosummary/functions.html>`__ to see what HofstadterTools has to offer.

Installation
------------

This package was developed using Ubuntu 20.04.6 (x86_64) with Python=3.10.13, however it is designed to be platform-independent and can work with any Python>=3.9.

Basic install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For basic usage of HofstadterTools, i.e. in cases where you *do not* plan on editing the source code, you can install the package from a distribution.

Using pip
*********

1. [Optional] Create and activate a new venv environment. In the example below, ``my_env_name`` is the name of the venv and ``my_env_folder`` is the name of its folder. If needed, you can replace ``python3`` with ``python3.xx`` below to create a venv pinned to a particular Python version.

.. code:: console

    user@domain:any/path$ python3 -m my_env_name my_env_folder
    user@domain:any/path$ source path/to/my_env_folder/bin/activate

2. Install HofstadterTools from PyPI.

.. code:: console

    (my_env_name) user@domain:any/path$ pip install HofstadterTools

3. [Optional] Upgrade an existing HofstadterTools installation.

.. code:: console

    (my_env_name) user@domain:any/path$ pip install --upgrade HofstadterTools

You can verify the installation by typing ``pip list | grep HofstadterTools``, you can uninstall by typing ``pip uninstall HofstadterTools``, and you can deactivate the environment by typing ``deactivate``. The entire environment can be removed by deleting ``my_env_folder``.

Using conda
***********

1. [Optional] Create and activate a new conda environment. In the example below, ``my_env_name`` is the name of the conda environment. If needed, you can replace ``python=3`` with ``python=3.xx`` below to create a conda environment with a particular Python version pre-installed.

.. code:: console

    user@domain:any/path$ conda create -n my_env_name python=3
    user@domain:any/path$ conda activate my_env_name

2. Install HofstadterTools from conda-forge.

.. code:: console

    (my_env_name) user@domain:any/path$ conda install conda-forge::HofstadterTools

3. [Optional] Update an existing HofstadterTools installation.

.. code:: console

    (my_env_name) user@domain:any/path$ conda update HofstadterTools

You can verify the installation by typing ``conda list | grep hofstadtertools``, you can uninstall by typing ``conda remove HofstadterTools``, and you can deactivate the environment by typing ``conda deactivate``. The entire environment can be removed by typing ``conda remove -n my_env_name --all``.

.. warning::

    If you pip install HofstadterTools into a conda environment, you may see a ``libGL error`` when you run the programs. This is a known problem with the ``libstdc++.so`` file in Conda and should not affect the functionality of HofstadterTools.

Advanced install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For advanced usage of HofstadterTools, i.e. in cases where you *do* plan on editing the source code, you can install the package from source.

1. Clone the HofstadterTools repository.

.. code:: console

    user@domain:any/path$ git clone git@github.com:HofstadterTools/HofstadterTools.git

2. Using pip, install the HofstadterTools package. This step can also be done in a virtual environment. The optional ``-e`` flag below indicates an editable install.

.. code:: console

    user@domain:path/to/HofstadterTools$ pip install -e .

Alternatively, if you plan on building the documentation locally, the optional ``docs`` dependencies need to be installed.

.. code:: console

    user@domain:path/to/HofstadterTools$ pip install -e ".[docs]"

3. [Optional] Build and view the documentation locally. The optional ``clean`` argument below removes files from the build directory, and ``firefox`` can be replaced with any web browser.

.. code:: console

    user@domain:path/to/HofstadterTools/docs$ make clean html
    user@domain:path/to/HofstadterTools/docs$ firefox build/html/index.html &

.. note::

    Building the documentation locally with the inheritance diagrams requires that the ``graphviz`` program is installed, so that the ``dot`` program is in the path. For example, on Debian systems, this can be achieved by typing ``sudo apt install graphviz``, and verified by typing ``dot -V``.

.. note::

    Implementing custom lattices with more than one site per unit cell requires an advanced install.

Testing
~~~~~~~

You can confirm that HofstadterTools is correctly installed by running the pytests.

.. code:: console

    user@domain:any/path$ pytest --pyargs HT

Once the *project* ``HofstadterTools`` is installed, the *package* ``HT`` will be available in your Python environment. In addition, you can access the programs ``band_structure``, ``butterfly``, ``plot_band_structure``, and ``plot_butterfly``, from any location.

.. code:: console

    user@domain:any/path$ band_structure --help
    user@domain:any/path$ butterfly --help
    user@domain:any/path$ plot_band_structure --help
    user@domain:any/path$ plot_butterfly --help

The ``plot_*`` programs are used to replot band_structures / butterflies that have been saved to file.
