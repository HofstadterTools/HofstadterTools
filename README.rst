**H**\ ofstadter\ **T**\ ools (\ **HT**) is a set of Python programs and classes for analyzing the Hofstadter model, which describes the behavior of non-interacting quantum particles hopping on a lattice coupled to a gauge field. This package can be used to compute the band structure of a *generalized* Hofstadter model on *any* regular Euclidean lattice, as well as its key properties, such as quantum geometry and topology.

.. admonition:: About the name

    Philip Harper first derived the difference equation for the model [`Harper55 <https://dx.doi.org/10.1088/0370-1298/68/10/304>`__], which was later analyzed in detail by Mark Azbel [`Azbel64 <http://jetp.ras.ru/cgi-bin/e/index/e/19/3/p634?a=list>`__], and finally plotted by Douglas Hofstadter [`Hofstadter76 <https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.14.2239>`__]. Consequently, the formal name for the model is the *Harper-Azbel-Hofstadter model* to credit its three main contributors.

Quick Start
-----------

Using HofstadterTools is quick and easy!

.. code:: console

    pip install HofstadterTools

You can now access the ``band_structure`` and ``butterfly`` programs from any location.

.. code:: console

    band_structure -lat square -nphi 1 4 --display both --wilson

Voilà! You have just plotted the Hofstadter band structure for nearest-neighbor hopping on the square lattice at flux density :math:`n_\phi=1/4`, together with the corresponding butterfly spectrum at :math:`q=97`. You can append ``--help`` to either of these programs to view the list of options. Alternatively, you can explore the `gallery <https://hofstadter.tools/gallery.html>`__ and `code reference <https://hofstadter.tools/_autosummary/functions.html>`__ to see what HofstadterTools has to offer.

Installation
------------

This package was developed using Ubuntu 20.04.6 (x86_64) with Python=3.10.13, however it is designed to be platform-independent and can work with any Python>=3.9.

Basic install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For basic usage of HofstadterTools, i.e. in cases where you *do not* plan on editing the source code, you can install the package quickly and easily from PyPI:

.. code:: console

    pip install HofstadterTools

To avoid dependency clashes, we recommend the use of a python virtual environment, such as ``venv``.

.. warning::

    If you install HofstadterTools into a conda environment, you may see a ``libGL error`` when you run the programs. This is a known problem with the ``libstdc++.so`` file in Conda and should not affect the functionality of HofstadterTools.

Advanced install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For advanced usage of HofstadterTools, i.e. in cases where you *do* plan on editing the source code, you can install the package from source.

.. code:: console

    user@domain:any/path$ git clone git@github.com:HofstadterTools/HofstadterTools.github.io.git HofstadterTools; cd HofstadterTools
    user@domain:path/to/HofstadterTools$ pip install -e .

The optional ``-e`` flag indicates an editable install. Alternatively, if you plan on building the documentation locally, the optional ``docs`` dependencies need to be installed.

.. code:: console

    user@domain:path/to/HofstadterTools$ pip install -e ".[docs]"

.. note::

    Implementing custom lattices with more than one site per unit cell requires an advanced install.

Testing
~~~~~~~

You can confirm that HofstadterTools is correctly installed by running the pytests.

.. code:: console

    user@domain:any/path$ pytest --pyargs HT

Once the *project* ``HofstadterTools`` is installed, the *package* ``HT`` will be available in your python environment. In addition, you can access the programs ``band_structure``, ``butterfly``, ``plot_band_structure``, and ``plot_butterfly``, from any location.

.. code:: console

    user@domain:any/path$ band_structure --help
    user@domain:any/path$ butterfly --help
    user@domain:any/path$ plot_band_structure --help
    user@domain:any/path$ plot_butterfly --help

The ``plot_*`` programs are used to replot band_structures / butterflies that have been saved to file.

Directory Structure
