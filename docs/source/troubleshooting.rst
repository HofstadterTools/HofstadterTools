Troubleshooting
===============

**Q.** I get an argparse error whenever one of my command line arguments is a negative number. What is correct syntax so that python does not interpret my negative numbers as flags?

**A.** If you would like to parse negative number arguments to command line flags, it's best to use quotation marks with a preceding space, e.g. ``-t 1 0 " -0.25"``.
